I'm perplexed by Vercel's stupid pricing.

- Their 20 dollar subscription fee scales with the size of your development team. Very odd pricing model for a hosting service.

- The overage costs are crazy expensive. It's almost always the case that they are a few times more expensive than the equivalents offered by AWS. This is understandable since they are built on AWS infrastractures, but still.

- They are (purposefully?) unclear about their pricing. Their website doesn't list the pricings so I had to do a non-trivial online researching to find out about these. I asked ChatGPT as well, and it just started explaining how bad they are lol.

I'm against BaaS platforms in general for their low flexibility, cost-effectiveness, having to be vendor locked-in, etc. Vercel is the epitome of this.

The only justifiable case to use Vercel is if:

- Your project is and will be so small you will not be burning money, and only benefit from the included quota.

- Your development team only consists of front-end engineers who have no idea about and can't work with cloud infrastructures, containers or servers in general (which is a problem to begin with outside BaaS stuff).

It's just bad.
